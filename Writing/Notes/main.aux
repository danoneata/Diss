The results are averaged over 30 repetitions, except for the results for NCA O1 which are collected after one experimentation. Abbreviations: NCA represents the simple NCA function, NCA CS denotes the version with compact support kernels, NCA CS BACK denotes the version that uses a background distribution and NCA O1 is the approximate version of simple NCA. Furthermore, 1-NN and NCA cls denote how the classification was done: either using a nearest neighbour rule or by using the function that was also used for learning.\relax }}{1}}
